# Z80-basic-leapfrog
this is not a direct port but my version of the leapfrog game from 30 programs for the zx81.
this was written on my sc108 z80 RC2014 compatible small board computer.
the code is very far from optimized and was simply an exercise in me getting my head around programming in basic after a very long lay off.
it was also about learning to use the terminal escape codes to enable printing at specific screen locations.
